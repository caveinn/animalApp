    There are two types of elephant, the Asian elephant and the African elephant (although sometimes the African Elephant is split into two species, the African Forest Elephant and the African Bush Elephant).

    Both female and male African elephants have tusks but only the male Asian elephants have tusks. They use their tusks for digging and finding food.
